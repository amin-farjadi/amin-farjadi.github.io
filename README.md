I have created a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, W3.CSS, Bootstrap 4 and SCSS as required.

The website includes the following pages:
- Home page: index.html
- Education page: education.html
- Experience page: experience.html
- Awards page: awards.html
- Contact page: contact.html

The following files are used for styling and images used:
- styles.css
- variables.scss
- variables.css
- profile.jpg

The "navbar.html" was used as a reference for the navigation bar used throughout the website.


Requirements are satisfied as follows:
- Website contains 5 .html pages
- Lists are used in education.html, experience.html and awards.html
- stylesheet file used
- #id used for making the website responsive (in style.css) and .class for setting the background color throughout
- @media used in styles.css
- Bootstrap 4 used in education.html, experience.html and awards.html
- SCSS variable, nesting and inheritance used in variables.scss
- README.md provided explaining what is included in the files and how the requirements are met
